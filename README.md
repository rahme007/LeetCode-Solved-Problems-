# LeetCode Problems
This is the collection of LeetCode Solved Problems.

<ol type = "1">
  <li> Pr-1 (Two Sum): Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

  <li> Pr-2 (Add Two Numbers): You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. <br>Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/ </li><br>
  <li>Pr-167 (Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted): Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

  <li>Pr-15 (3Sum):Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
