# LeetCode Problems
This is the collection of LeetCode Solved Problems.

<ol type = "1">
  <li> Pr-1 (Two Sum): Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
    <br>Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ </li> <br>
  <li> Pr-2 (Add Two Numbers): You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. <br>Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/ </li><br>
  <li> Pr-26 Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements. Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums. Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.<br>

  <li>Pr-167 (Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted): Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

  <li>Pr-15 (3Sum):Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

  <li>Pr-155 (Min Stack) Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

  <li> Pr-101 (Symmetric Tree) Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

  <li> Pr-1424[C++] (Diagonal Traverse II) Given a 2D integer array nums, return all elements of nums in diagonal order as shown in the below images.

  <li> Pr-1561[C++] (Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get) There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:
    <ul style= “list-style-type⚫>
    <li>In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive). </li>
    <li>Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.</li>
    <li>You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins. </li>
    <li>Your friend Bob will pick the last pile. </li>
    <li>Repeat until there are no more piles of coins. </li> </ul>
  <br>Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile. Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.

  <li> Pr-917[C++] (Reverse Only Letters) Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:
    <ul style= “list-style-type⚫>
    <li>All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position. </li>
    <li>All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.</li> </ul>
    <br> Return s after reversing it.

  <li> Pr-203 [C++] (Remove Linked List Elements): Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head
    <br>Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/description/ </li> <br>
  <li> Pr-2095 [C++] (Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List): You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list. The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.
  <ul style= “list-style-type⚫> <li>For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively. </li> </ul>
